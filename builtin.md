# Built-in features
The features listed below are built into Paper and are not configurable

### Optimized liquid draining
(Amongst other things?), draining is optimized in paper by not updating the anti-xray stuff(?)

### Optimized chests TEs
Chests, a tile entity, no longer ticks in paper as it isn't needed, allowing chunks with tons of chests to not be an issue.
